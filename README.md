# coding-practice
This is my public repository holding all my coding practice material whilst beggining to learn how to code.
I'm starting with C, C++, Python, POSIX SH, and Microsoft PowerShell Core (the cross-platform version).

All code pushed to this repository is freely available to be used by anyone, provided they follow the GPLv3.
As of now, these programs just show very basic examples of the language structure in use.
